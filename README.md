# Semi-supervised Clustering for Text via CNN

Now under development.
Based on “Semi-supervised Clustering for Short Text via Deep Representation Learning” by Zhiguo Wang, Haitao Mi, Abraham Ittycheriah, [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06797.pdf).

## Dependencies

* Learned word2vec model can be download from this [link](http://aial.shiroyagi.co.jp/2017/02/japanese-word2vec-model-builder/). Thank you, Yada-san , Shiroyagi Corporation.
* The Keras Deep Learning library and TensorFlow backend should be installed.
